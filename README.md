# Raspberry Pi Temperature Sensors

How to setup a raspberry pi with multiple DS18B20 (temperature) sensors

---

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry pi 3
- Micro SD-card
- 1 (or more) DS18B20 temperature sensors
- 1 breakout board (so you won't have to fiddle with a resistor and bread board)
- Jumper cables

## Setup

This is my personal setup. There's probably tons of different ways to get this done but here you have my take on it.

1. Follow the [instructions on how to setup a headless raspberry pi](https://hackernoon.com/raspberry-pi-headless-install-462ccabd75d0) 
2. Connect your sensors to the raspberry pi follogin this youtube instruction:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7LLVkPpQ78
